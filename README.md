# RF Simulation Tool
###### We are pleased to present our RF simulation tool, which we developed as a minor project during the final year of our college studies. This tool is designed to enable users to simulate the behavior of RF components and systems, allowing them to analyze and optimize their performance. It incorporates a range of advanced features and functionalities, including support for waveguides, E-plane tees, and H-planes, as well as the ability to measure insertion loss and other key performance metrics. We believe that this tool represents a significant contribution to the field of RF engineering, and we hope that it will be of value to a wide range of users and applications.
